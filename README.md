David McClain | Dirtyredz

I'm David McClain a self taught Developer with over 6 years experience. I started my Programming career while I was serving in the Unites States Marine Corps. Not many say they love the work they do, and in both my careers that's what I've done.
Building websites is my Passion. I get lost in my work when making a Website. I love taking in all the elements that describe a Personallity, concept, or idea; and bringing it into one place for All to See.
